This repository contains a scientific poster titled "AI and Cybersecurity", produced as part of my Master's-level academic project at Aix-Marseille University (FSI – Reliability and Security in Computer Science).

# AI & Cybersecurity – Scientific Poster

The poster explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, highlighting both opportunities and limitations, with a focus on technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Federated Learning (FL).

## Poster Overview

### Topics covered:
- AI for cyber defense: threat detection, prediction, and automation
- NLP applied to phishing detection
- Data processing: tokenization, stop-word filtering, stemming/lemmatization
- Word representation: Bag of Words, TF-IDF
- AI models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Transformers (BERT, GPT), RNNs
- Federated Learning as a decentralized alternative to centralized AI training

### Security risks explored:
- Data Poisoning: injecting biased or malicious data into local models
- Model Poisoning: sending manipulated updates during federated training
- Explainability and trust in AI decisions for security-critical systems

## Key Concepts

- Federated Learning: training AI models across multiple decentralized devices without sharing raw data
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): using AI to analyze and understand human language, applied to phishing and threat detection
- AI in Cybersecurity: enabling faster attack detection, predictive defense, and threat mitigation at scale
